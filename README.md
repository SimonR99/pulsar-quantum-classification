# pulsar-quantum-classification

This project has the goal to replicate the results of the paper "Pulsar Classification: Comparing Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks and Quantum Support Vector Machines" by D Slabbert, M Lourens and F Petruccione. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15592). 


## Implementation

For this replication, we created all model discuss in the paper. This includes a QCNN, QSVM, QNN and their classical counterparts. The models were implemented using the Pennylane library and the classical models were implemented using the scikit-learn library.
